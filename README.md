Electric Imp to ThingSpeak
=======================
Electric Imp is a connectivity platform for connecting Wi-Fi devices to cloud services, much like [RealTime.io](http://realtime.io) and Iota Wi-Fi modules and Spark.io. Some Electric Imp module's come in an SD card form factor and adds Wi-Fi connectivity to what's connected to the Electric Imp module. Access to the Electric Module happens via the Electric Imp cloud and its APIs. While connectivity is simplified with the Electric Imp system, you will need a data service like ThingSpeak to complete the Internet of Things experience. Once data from Electric Imp devices are in [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com), you can easily build applications and interactivity with other devices and platforms.

## Electric Imp to ThingSpeak Overview
Once an Electric Imp module is connected to a local Wi-Fi network, the module can post data to ThingSpeak via an "agent" running on the Electric Imp Cloud. Any data can be sent to ThingSpeak and then retrieved via ThingSpeak APIs.
